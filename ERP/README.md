# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Documentation (For my planning):

# Server:

The "server" folder will contain all the middlewares and routes to manage the different APIs. 
This includes CRUD operations on the MongoDB database, password hashing and 2FA authentication. 


# React GUI:

The "scr" folder will contain the "pages"/modules files and the different components, which they use.

# To do:

- Recap Express - How to manage routes etc
- Learn MongoDB - How to perform CRUD operations (this will be done as APIs)
- Develop React knowledge and how to use Tailwind (CSS)
- Creat a basic UI structure - Allows me to focus development on specific features
